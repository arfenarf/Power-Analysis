# Power-Analysis
Practice project for exercising R data cleaning and exploratory skills

-excel-based-start - directory containing first attempt and output graph for May 15 rides: 
took the XML file and crammed it through Excel for the first pass.  Code files in there barely
better than scratchpad and history dumps.

xml-loading-parsing.R: script file focused on ability to read TCX files and turn them into usable data

xml-to-graph.R: script file that takes those data tables and tries to make them into interesting information

Next steps:
* lose the one-off nature of the analysis and build more generic functions
* try to get better knobs and dials available to support interactive exploration
